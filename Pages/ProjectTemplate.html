					A pair of railguns that are mounted on the waist, they have an excellent rate of fire and high ammunition capacity. Folded into three parts when not in use, they can be used to deal with situations where beam weapons are ineffective, such as against underwater enemies, and are the suit's most powerful solid-based weaponry. They are developed based on the Duel Gundam Assault Shroud's "Shiva" railgun. Although the railguns have foldable grips at the sides, they can be fired without the grips being held in hands. Additionally, the last section of each railgun is equipped with a thruster that can be used for attitude controls.
